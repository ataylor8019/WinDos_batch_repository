Required downloads -
From github.com/ataylor8019/SQLStore -

SetupPizzaMakerFileFlattenTables.sql
SetupPizzaMakerFileFlattenRawTextFileLoad.sql
SetupCUSTOMERLOAD_PROCEDURE.sql
SetupMENULOAD_PROCEDURE.sql
SetupORDERSLOAD_PROCEDURE.sql
SetupORDEREDITEMSLOAD_PROCEDURE.sql

From github.com/ataylor8019/PizzaRecordConvertor -
Download the solution PizzaRecordConvertor from branch "master" or executable "PizzaRecordConvertor.exe" from (to be updated in future release)

From github.com/ataylor8019/WinDos_batch_repository
PizzaMakerSyncProcess.bat

Setup instructions:

On system which will run the record conversion:

Compile the solution PizzaRecordConvertor, if you did not download the EXE.
Ensure that the exe (whether gotten from the site or compiled) is placed where there are no sensitive files or directories.
Place the files to be converted in a location where there are no sensitive files or directories.
Start the executable (by clicking the icon or using the Run command in Windows)
Use the buttons to point the executable to the location of the order files to be converted.
Press the appropriate button (saying something like "begin order conversion") to begin the order conversion.

If successful, the import data will be in a file named "ImportReadyData.txt" in a subfolder named "DatabaseReadyFiles".
Any order files that were not read will be in a subfolder named "FailedOrderReads".
Any errors encountered during the read will be in a subfolder named "Errors".
Files that were successfully read will remain in the location where they were placed.

On system that will store the records (may or may not be the same as the record conversion system):

Ensure that all of the named SQL files and PizzaMakerSyncProcess.bat are on the record system.
Ensure that the file "ImportReadyData.txt" is on the record system.
"PizzaMakerSyncProcess.bat" should be placed where only trusted users can access it, and regularly monitored for changes.

Run the SQL files in the following order:

SetupPizzaMakerFileFlattenTables.sql
SetupCUSTOMERLOAD_PROCEDURE.sql
SetupMENULOAD_PROCEDURE.sql
SetupORDERSLOAD_PROCEDURE.sql
SetupORDEREDITEMSLOAD_PROCEDURE.sql

If not already done, "PizzaMakerSyncProcess.bat" should be edited to point to the location where the import file is located. If the location has been preset, then skip the next section.

Open "PizzaMakerSyncProcess.bat". The file contains the following:
---

@ECHO OFF
SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION

sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d PIZZALOGISTICS -Q "EXEC SetupPizzaInformationStore"
sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d PIZZALOGISTICS -Q "EXEC BULKPIZZADATA_RAWIMPORT @FILENAME=$(IMPORTFILE)" -v IMPORTFILE=""
sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d PIZZALOGISTICS -Q "EXEC CUSTOMERLOAD"
sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d PIZZALOGISTICS -Q "EXEC MENULOAD"
sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d PIZZALOGISTICS -Q "EXEC ORDERSLOAD"
sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d PIZZALOGISTICS -Q "EXEC ORDEREDITEMSLOAD"


---

Edit the 4th line of text to look like the following:

sqlcmd -Snp:\\.\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\sql\query -d TestPizzaImport -Q "EXEC BULKPIZZADATA_RAWIMPORT @FILENAME=$(IMPORTFILE)" -v IMPORTFILE="'[FileLocation]\ImportReadyData.txt'"

The text [FileLocation] should be replaced with the location of the file "ImportReadyData.txt" on the system. Type everything else, including quotes, exactly as shown above.


Run the following SQL file:

SetupPizzaMakerFileFlattenRawTextFileLoad.sql

The process is now ready to be run.


Import instructions:

Simply run "PizzaMakerSyncProcess.bat" at the command line in the location where it has been placed. 

File data will be output into the following tables:

CUSTOMERS
MENU
ORDERS
ORDEREDITEMS
